# The Android key store contains a signing key with the label 'release' that
# the Serval Project uses to sign all of its Alpha, Beta and Release APKs, so
# that auto upgrade across these streams can be performed.  This property can
# be overridden for specific build targets, eg: 'debug.android.key.alias',
# 'beta.android.key.alias', etc.

# Developer-specific properties such as 'android.key.store' and
# 'serval.keyring.path' and the various 'debug.serval.*' properties must NOT be
# set in this file.  Set them in a personal ant.properties file instead, and
# set the SERVAL_BATPHONE_ANT_PROPERTIES environment var to the full path of
# that file.

# The Serval release keyring contains a single identity that is used to author
# all the Rhizome auto-upgrade bundles.  This is its SID.
