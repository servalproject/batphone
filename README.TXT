Wifi Tether for Root Users
--------------------------

This software turns your android-based handset (tested with a T-Mobile G1) into "something" like
a wireless-accesspoint (that's incorrect in technical-view because the wireless-interface will be 
set-up in AdHoc-Mode). Clients can connect via wifi and get access to internet using the 3G-connection
(GPRS/EDGE/UMTS/HSDPA) which is established by the handset.

Warning:
--------
This application needs root-permission.
