    <h1>Serval Connect</h1>
    <p>Without a Wi-Fi network connection to at least another phone, the Serval
    Mesh software cannot provide any useful function.
    </p>
    <p>The <em>Enable Services</em> checkbox, when ON, causes your device to
    periodically announce its presence to the Wi-Fi network and sync Rhizome
    and MeshMS with all other devices.  This will drain your battery while
    connected to a Wi-Fi network, even when the screen is off.
    </p>
    <p>Below the checkbox are different options for connecting to a Wi-Fi
    network:
    </p>
    <h2>Wi-Fi</h2>
    <p>The settings icon opens the Android Wi-Fi settings screen, which allows
    you to choose a Wi-Fi network.
    </p>
    <p>The checkbox turns Wi-Fi on and off, letting Android choose the Wi-Fi
    network to connect to, if it can.
    </p>
    <h2>Portable Wi-Fi Hotspot</h2>
    <p>The settings icon opens the Android Portable Wi-Fi Hotspot settings
    screen.
    </p>
    <p>The checkbox turns your Portable Wi-Fi Hotspot on and off.  When turning
    on, your existing hotspot settings are overwritten with the Serval Mesh
    settings, which includes setting the hotspot name (SSID) to
    "ap.servalproject.org".  When the hotspot is turned off, your existing
    settings are restored, which you can see because your hotspot briefly turns
    back on and off again.
    </p>
    <p>WARNING: Turning on the Portable Wi-Fi Hotspot TURNS OFF NORMAL WI-FI,
    so services like sync, messaging, calendar, etc. may use your mobile data
    plan and COST YOU MONEY.
    </p>
    <p>WARNING: Turning on a Portable Wi-Fi Hotspot gives other people access
    to your mobile data plan, which could COST YOU MONEY.
    </p>
    <h2>Ad Hoc Mesh</h2>
    <p>Pressing the "Ad Hoc Mesh" text starts testing whether Ad Hoc Wi-Fi will
    work on your device.  This involves testing whether Super User (root) is
    available, and if it is, re-installing the system Wi-Fi driver.  THIS CAN
    CAUSE YOUR DEVICE TO BE PERMANENTLY DAMAGED.
    </p>
    <p>Once Ad Hoc Wi-Fi has been tested and found available, the checkbox
    turns Ad Hoc Wi-Fi mode on and off.
    </p>
    <p>WARNING: Turning on Ad Hoc Wi-Fi TURNS OFF NORMAL WI-FI, so services
    like sync, messaging, calendar, etc. may use your mobile data plan and COST
    YOU MONEY.
